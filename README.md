# Web Component Tool Kit

Build web components quickly.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://github.com/wolfpup-software/wctk-js
```

## Controllers

Features like reactivity and subscriptions are compositional and optional.

A handful of utility classes can:

- wrangle the [shadow dom](./docs/shadow.md)
- [style](./docs/styles.md) web components
- asynchronously [render](./docs/render.md) components
- bind [events](./docs/events.md) to components
- [subscribe](./docs/subscription.md) components to external data

## Developer Experience

`Wctk` builds web components with an extremely tiny foot print. (~<5kb unminified and uncompressed).

It directly correlates with vanilla web component features and jargon.
