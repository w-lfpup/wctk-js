# Web Component Tool Kit

Build web components quickly.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://github.com/wolfpup-software/wctk-js
```

## Controllers

A handful of controller classes can:

- wrangle declarative and imperative [shadow dom](./docs/shadow.md)
- [style](./docs/styles.md) web components
- [render](./docs/render.md) asynchronously
- bind [events](./docs/events.md) to web compoonents
- [subscribe](./docs/subscription.md) to external data



## Developer Experience

`Wctk` builds web components with an extremely tiny foot print.

It's designed to directly correlate with vanilla web component features and jargon.

`Wctk` is based on my experience with the [Lit](https://lit.dev) team.
