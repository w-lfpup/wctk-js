# Web Component Tool Kit

`Wctk` is a compositional approach to web components.

## Controllers

A handful of controllers can provide:

- declarative or imperative shadow dom -> [Shadow](./shadow/README.md)
- asynchronous renders -> [Render](./render/README.md)
- events and bindings -> [Events](./events/README.md)
- subscriptions to data stores -> [Subscription](./subscription/README.md)
- styles -> the [Styles](./styles/README.md)

## Details

`Wctk` is less than _600 bytes_ minified and zipped.
