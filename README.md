# The Web Component Tool Kit

Build web components with bare metal browser tools.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev https://github.com/wolfpup-software/wctk-js
```

## Controllers

Features like reactivity and subscriptions are compositional.

A handful of utility classes can:

- wrangle the shadow dom and create a [web component](./docs/web_component.md)
- add reactivity and [renders](./docs/render.md) to components
- bind [events](./docs/events.md) to components
- [subscribe](./docs/subscription.md) components to external data

## Developer Experience

`Wctk` builds web components with an extremely tiny foot print. (~<5kb unminified and uncompressed).

It directly correlates with vanilla web component features and jargon.

The `wctk` is based on my experiences at Google on the [Lit](https://lit.dev) team.

Less is more in this wolf's opinion.
