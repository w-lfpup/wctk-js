# Web Component Tool Kit

`Wctk` is a compositional approach to web components.

## Controllers

A handful of controllers can provide:

- declarative or imperative shadow dom -> [Shadow](./shadow/README.md)
- asynchronous renders -> [Render](./render/README.md)
- events and bindings -> [Events](./events/README.md)
- subscriptions to data stores -> [Subscribe](./subscribe/README.md)
- styles -> the [Styles](./styles/README.md)



## Details

`Wctk` weighs in at hefty 500 bytes minified and zipped.

There are no DOM managers included in `wctk`.

Wolfpup doesn't know _how_ you will integrate external libraries into your application. Wolfpup doesn't care.
