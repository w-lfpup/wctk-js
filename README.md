# Web Component Tool Kit

Build web components quickly (<600 bytes minified and zipped).

## Controllers

A handful of controller classes can wrangle:

- declarative or imperative [shadow](./shadow/README.md) dom
- component [styles](./styles/README.md)
- asynchronous [renders](./render/README.md)
- [events](./events/README.md) and bindings
- [subscriptions](./subscription/README.md) to external data 

## Developer Experience

`Wctk` is a set of opt-in compositional utility classes to quickly build web components.

`Wctk` is designed to directly correlate with vanilla web component features and jargon. It attempts to reduce unneccessary complexity while avoiding inheritance.

## License

`Wctk` is released under the BSD-3 Clause License.
